# Writing BSc/MSc Theses and Reports

This repository contains a LaTeX template for writing BSc/MSc theses and reports in general (e.g., for an internship or short programming project). The template also contains limited guidance to help with some aspects of the writing.

This template is maintained by, and therefore applies to, the [Software Engineering and Architecture group](https://www.cs.rug.nl/search/) of the [Faculty of Science and Engineering](https://www.rug.nl/fse/?lang=en) of the University of Groningen. That being said, it may be applicable to other groups or purposes, in which case you are using the template and guidance at your own risk.

## Guidelines \& Tips

Look at the LaTeX template for more information about:
- how to structure the thesis or report; and
- LaTeX instructions.

The easiest way to get started with the template
is to create a blank project on [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com/)
and upload a copy of this repository to it.
That will provide out-of-the-box:
- version control;
- track change; and
- review support (comments and discussion).

This is not a LaTeX tutorial.
If you are not used to LaTeX, take the time to get yourself acquainted
and explore the template. Part of the time-consuming tasks (e.g. layout)
are solved already. Adding your content should be fairly straightforward
(maybe tables less so).

You might, or might not, be interested in taking a look at [this style guide](https://vandriko.github.io/writing-style-guide/) as a way of avoiding common mistakes.

## After Submitting your Thesis or Report

Provide any feedback related to these guidelines and the template by:
- opening an issue in the repository;
- submitting a pull-request or
- messaging your supervisor.
